# Auto-Claim-Mudae-Self-Bot

## Disclaimer

Automating user accounts is against the Discord ToS. I don't recommend using it. Do so at your own risk.

## Overview

Python script that requires settings to mimic your rolling behavior of claiming kakera and rolls for the mudae waifu game. First it's setup with the given settings, then rolls every hour on given channels, validates messages so that it only reads the given channels and Mudae's messages, discerns if is a claimable roll or a kakera claim, then checks if it should claim with it's settings or if is the last claim hour to add the roll to claims, when one roll is added after given delay will check it's rolls to choose the one with the highest kakera value (will always prioritize the wished ones if there is any).

## What does it do

- Claims wishlist characters and given ones.
- Claims by series.
- Claims kakera.
- Claims with given delay.
- Claims with last hour claim.
- Checks if dk and rt are available to use them.
- Reconnects.

## Cool things to add

- Adjust to different restart claims. Currently I dont know how does the 120 minute claim works to make it.
- Currently is made for kakera value efficiency. It would be cool to use rt only for wished ones or have different modes if there are any.
- Choose which kakera color you wanna claim.
- Adjust claim kakera cost for characters with 10+ keys.
- No need to provide the $ku, $mu and $rtu to settings and get them at setup.
- Tests.

## Known Issues

- When someone else claims first it still believes it claimed.

## Notes

- I don't really use github. I'm a new programmer who wants to be a great one so any criticism is welcome.
- This project was heavily inspired by this deprecated [one](https://github.com/vivinano/MudaeAutoBot).
- I planned to use the library discord.py-self. But I think some tests where on the regular discord.py because i didn't specify my virtual enviroment so it probably works with both.
- Tested in private servers with a few players.
